# Date Counter Plugin

**Date Counter Plugin** replaces any occurrence of `%YYYY-MM-DD%` in your notes with the number of days since that date. The plugin works in edit mode using CodeMirror 6, displaying an inline widget that shows the computed number of days without altering your underlying text.

## Features

- **Inline Date Counter:** Automatically calculates and displays the number of days since the specified date.
- **Edit Mode Integration:** Uses CodeMirror 6 extensions to show results directly in the editor.
- **Non-Intrusive:** The original `%YYYY-MM-DD%` text remains intact for easy editing.
